essentia
========

Essentia is an open-source C++ library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval released under 
the Affero GPL license. It contains an extensive collection of reusable algorithms which implement audio input/output 
functionality, standard digital signal processing blocks, statistical characterization of data, and a large set of 
spectral, temporal, tonal and high-level music descriptors. The library is also wrapped in Python and includes a number 
of predefined executable extractors for the available music descriptors, which facilitates its use for fast prototyping 
and allows setting up research experiments very rapidly. Furthermore, it includes a Vamp plugin to be used with 
Sonic Visualiser for visualization purposes. The library is cross-platform and currently supports Linux, Mac OS X, 
and Windows systems. Essentia is designed with a focus on the robustness of the provided music descriptors and is 
optimized in terms of the computational cost of the algorithms. The provided functionality, specifically the music 
descriptors included in-the-box and signal processing algorithms, is easily expandable and allows for both research 
experiments and development of large-scale industrial applications.
