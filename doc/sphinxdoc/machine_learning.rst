.. How to use TensorFlow models and Gaia SVM classifiers 

Using machine learning models
=======================

Essentia includes algorithms for running inference with data-driven machine learning models that can be used for high-level annotation of music audio.
Specifically, Essentia provides a wrapper for TensorFlow that allows using virtually any TensorFlow model within our audio analysis framework.

We provide pre-trained models for various music analysis and classification tasks.
Current :ref:`Essentia Models` are based on TensorFlow.

*Note*: We also provide legacy `Gaia SVM models <gaia_svm_models.html>`_ based on handcrafted music audio features.
These models have been superseded by our current models.


Installation
------------

Essentia with TensorFlow support is available for Linux and macOS as a separate Python package, `essentia-tensoflow <https://pypi.org/project/essentia-tensorflow/>`_:

.. code-block::

    pip install essentia-tensorflow

Additionally, we provide `instructions <https://mtg.github.io/essentia-labs/news/tensorflow/2019/10/19/tensorflow-models-in-essentia/>`_ to build and use Essentia with the TensorFlow wrapper.
See our blog posts `[1] <https://mtg.github.io/essentia-labs/news/tensorflow/2019/10/19/tensorflow-models-in-essentia/>`_ `[2] <https://mtg.github.io/essentia-labs/news/tensorflow/2020/01/16/tensorflow-models-released/>`_ for further details about some of the models.


Building Essentia with TensorFlow support 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alternatively, we provide instructions to build Essentia from source and link it against the shared TensorFlow libraries.
To avoid collisions when importing both Essentia and TensorFlow in Python, we use the shared libraries whithin the Python package of TensorFlow itself instead of linking against the official `libtensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c>`_.

Steps: 

1. At least pip version â‰¥19.3 is required:

    .. code-block::

        pip3 install --upgrade pip

2. Install TensorFlow (tested for TensorFlow 2.5, 2.8, 2.12):

    .. code-block::

        pip3 install tensorflow

3. Clone Essentia: 

    .. code-block::

        git clone https://github.com/MTG/essentia.git

4. Run `setup_from_python.sh` (may require `sudo`). This script exposes the shared libraries contained in the TensorFlow wheel so we can link against them:

    .. code-block::

        cd essentia && src/3rdparty/tensorflow/setup_from_python.sh

5. Install the `dependencies <https://essentia.upf.edu/installing.html#installing-dependencies-on-linux>`_ for Essentia with Python 3 (may require `sudo`):

    .. code-block::

        apt-get install build-essential libyaml-dev libfftw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev python-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtag1-dev libchromaprint-dev python-six python3-dev python3-numpy-dev python3-numpy python3-yaml libeigen3-dev

6. Configure Essentia with TensorFlow and Python 3:

    .. code-block::

        python3 waf configure --build-static --with-python --with-tensorflow

7. Build everything:

    .. code-block::

        python3 waf

8. Install:

    .. code-block::

        python3 waf install


Inference with GPU
-----------------
It is possible to run inference with Essentia Models using GPU when the correct version of the CUDA and CuDNN libraries are installed on your system.
We recommend using a package manager such as `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ to install the required components.

These are the recommended steps to follow:

1. Install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ (or Anaconda).
2. Create and activate a Conda environment: 

    .. code-block::

        conda create -n ess python=3.10
        conda activate ess

3. Install CUDA, CuDNN, and essentia-tensorflow:

    .. code-block::

        conda install -c conda-forge -y cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1
        pip install essentia-tensorflow

 
    It is possible to use CUDA environment variables to control the GPU usage.
    For example, the following line of code launches a script using GPU 1:

    .. code-block::

      CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python my_script.py
