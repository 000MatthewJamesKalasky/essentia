This directory includes python and Jupyter (iPython Notebook) examples for the synthesis algorithms in essentia.

1- STFT model (analysis/synthesis)
2- Sine model (analysis/synthesis)
3- Sine subtraction
4- Sinusoidal plus Residual model (analysis/synthesis) 
5- Sinusoidal plus Stochastic model (analysis/synthesis)
